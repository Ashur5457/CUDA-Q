# CUDA-Q Playground ‚≠ê


This repository is just an entry point to easily set up and familiarize anyone with [**CUDA-Q**](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-q) on either [TWCC](https://github.com/Squirtle007/CUDA-Q/blob/main/README.md#cuda-q-on-twcc) or [Colab](https://github.com/Squirtle007/CUDA-Q/blob/main/README.md#cuda-q-on-colab).
<br>
To explore the full capabilities and in-depth information of CUDA-Q, see the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/index.html).
<br>
For more advanced tutorials, please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/tree/main/docs/sphinx/examples/python) in the [**NVIDIA official GitHub**](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/):

## CUDA-Q on TWCC
Taiwan Computing Cloud (TWCC) is a high-performance computing service/portal backed by the National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC). The CUDA-Q container is pre-installed in the TWCC infrastructure and can be easily set up through the user-friendly WebUI.
<br>
<br>
## CUDA-Q on Colab
Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment providing free access to GPUs. This repository includes minimal dependencies to simply install CUDA-Q via PyPI.
